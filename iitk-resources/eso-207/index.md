This is the webpage for the course ESO207 that I did during Spring 2020. The course was taught by Prof. Anil Seth.   

There were in total four assignments during the course whose solutions can be found below. I am not able to post my solutions to the Mid Term and End Term as I have not typesetted those yet.
