This is the webpage for the course CS201 that I did during Spring 2020. The course was taught by Prof. Manindra Agarwal.   

The course was divided into four parts i.e. Set Theory, Counting of sets, Graph Theory and Abstract Algebra. The four assignments provided below cover these topics respectively.
