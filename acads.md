This page is an attempt to house my solutions and projects for the coursework that I will be doing at IITK. I initially planned it to just act as some means for me to look behind, at the kind of work I did, but now that I think about it, I would be happy enough if someone besides me also finds it resourceful. You are free to use the resources in any way that you like, keeping in mind just one fact which I have pointed out as an _Important Remark_ below.  

* [Notes](/blog/notes)
* [IITK Resources](/blog/iitk-resources), collection of resources for various courses done by me at IITK.

\
_Important Remark_ : Please do not ask me to update the site with course assignments and exams for every year. This website is in **NO WAY**, an attempt to create a big repository rather it's just a means to house the coursework that I will be doing during my bachelor's at IITK.
