Hi there, you have reached my personal blogsite.

This is where I will put my stuff related to acads, my projects, stuff that I find cool and finally a blog where I plan to write some tutorial as well as some personal experiences I would like to share. 

The links for the same can be found below and as well as on nav-bar although the ones in nav-bar are a little bit more extensive and contain more content. 

# Links

[This](/blog/courses) is a list of courses that I have taken and am doing.

[This](/blog/cool_stuff) is a list of some stuff that I find really interesting. 

If you are looking for my academic homepage (which is more professional and hence, boring), you can find it [here](https://yatharth0610.github.io)

## Academics
* [Notes](/blog/notes)
* [IITK Resources](/blog/iitk-resources), collection of resources for various courses done by me at IITK.

\
_Important Remark_ : Please do not ask me to update the site with course assignments and exams for every year. This website is in **NO WAY**, an attempt to create a big repository rather it's just a means to house the coursework that I will be doing during my bachelor's at IITK.
